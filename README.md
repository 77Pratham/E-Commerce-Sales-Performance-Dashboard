## ‚ú® Key Features & Analysis

* **Real-Time Filtering:** The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter data by year, product category, and other dimensions to get real-time insights.
* **Advanced DAX Calculations:** Implemented complex DAX measures to calculate key business metrics, including:
    * Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
    * Customer Retention Rate
    * Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales Growth
* **Customer Segmentation:** Utilized RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers into actionable groups like "Champions," "Loyal Customers," and "At-Risk."
* **Interactive User Experience:** Enhanced the dashboard with drill-through pages for deep-dive analysis and custom tooltips for rich, contextual information on hover.
* **Data Modeling:** Built on a robust star schema data model to ensure performance and scalability.

## üí° DAX Measures Showcase

Here are a few examples of the advanced DAX measures used in this project:

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

This measure calculates the predicted total revenue a business can expect from a single customer account.

```dax
Customer Lifetime Value =
VAR AvgPurchaseFrequency = DIVIDE([Total Orders], [Total Customers])
VAR AvgPurchaseValue = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])
VAR CustomerLifetime = 365 / (1 - [Customer Retention Rate]) // Simplified lifetime in days
RETURN
    AvgPurchaseValue * AvgPurchaseFrequency * CustomerLifetime
```

### YoY Sales Growth

This measure calculates the percentage change in sales compared to the same period in the previous year.

```dax
YoY Sales Growth % =
VAR SalesCurrentYear = [Total Sales]
VAR SalesPreviousYear = CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))
RETURN
    DIVIDE(SalesCurrentYear - SalesPreviousYear, SalesPreviousYear)
```
